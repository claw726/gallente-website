  "introduction": "Democracy in the Gallente Federation is the very core to the union's foundations. Fundamentally, it means that power ultimately rests with the people. How this is interpreted and executed varies exponentially. While it generally means that the government is accountable to its electorate, it also means popular participation in political discourse is encouraged amongst the citizens, and not necessarily within the halls of government. Whereas citizens of other empires are expected to follow their governments in relative silence (or otherwise have little to no say in the political process), members of the Federation citizenry are actively encouraged to be the ones dictating the political process, all in the pursuit of abiding by the democratic principle of ‘rule of the people’. Below is a general (and some may say limited) overview of democracy in the Gallente Federation. Large elements of Gallente democracy do not necessarily pertain to government and politics, but may manifest itself through religion, culture, or society instead.",
